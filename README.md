# A number of projects created to study different approaches and tools in testing

## Application under test

All projects will be using [Golang Web Application](https://github.com/Asangin/go-webapp-sample) as a application under
test.
It's a [fork](https://github.com/ybkuroki/go-webapp-sample) of application that was made
by [Yuta Kuroki](https://github.com/ybkuroki)

So before running some test projects, we need to deploy the application locally, deployment described
in [README](https://github.com/Asangin/go-webapp-sample/blob/master/README.md#starting-server). However, some
the project will have running AUT as a precondition.
